# Largest palindrome product

# Problem 4

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# possibility 1
# max 3 digits * 3 digits numbers
# nested loops & iterate until you find a palindrome..
# = BAD


# possibility 2
# iterate backword from largest number (product of 999*999) and find dividers

# Rappel: primary factor decomposition?
